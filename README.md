Scary Coil Head
Version: 0.1.0 (work in progress)

The Scary Coil Head Mod is designed to enhance the thrill of your gaming experience by introducing a more menacing behavior to the Coil Heads. 
With this mod, Coil Heads now have a random chance of pursuing you or your crewmates when you catch their gaze. Importantly, during this pursuit phase, they will not cause harm.

In the current implementation, there is a 1 in 1800 chance per frame that a Coil Head will start moving towards a player, translating to a 3% chance per second. 
When activated, the Coil Head will cover 50% of the distance between itself and the targeted player.

Current Issues (v0.1.0)
- Animation synchronization has some glitches

Planned Updates
- Introduction of settings to cutsomize the chance of movement and the distance covered
- Configurable attack feature
